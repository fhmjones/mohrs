## Mohr's circles

**Purpose:** Manipulate Mohr's circles for analysis of stress in the Earth's crust.

**Background:**
- The supplamentary e-module for [chapters 4 & 5, "Stress"](https://folk.uib.no/nglhe/StructuralGeoBookEmodules2ndEd.html) in Haakon Fossen's textbook "Structural Geology".
- See also the second half of [Ch. 6 of Allmendinger (PDF)](http://www.geo.cornell.edu/geology/faculty/RWA/structure-lab-manual/chapter-6.pdf).

**Instructions:**
Two tabs: One changes Mohr's circle by adjusting deviatoric and mean stress and the other by adjusting sigma_1 and sigma_3.
