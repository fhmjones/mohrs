## Mohr's circles

**Purpose:** Manipulate Mohr's circles for analysis of stress in the Earth's crust.

Two versions (eventually to become tabs in one app): One with adjustable deviatoric and mean stress and a second with adjustable sigma1 and sigma3.

**Background:** Lecture content from a first-exposure course on geological structures (the "stress" lesson), and some accompanying materials are included as PDFs.
For more comprehensive geological context try second half of [Ch. 6 of Allmendinger (PDF)](http://www.geo.cornell.edu/geology/faculty/RWA/structure-lab-manual/chapter-6.pdf), at Cornell.

**Instructions:** Explore the dashboard and its controls.
