# Mohr's Circles

Experimental dashboard app for exploring geological stress and structures by manipulating Mohr's circles

Two tabs: One changes Mohr's circle by adjusting deviatoric and mean stress and the other by adjusting sigma_1 and sigma_3.

PDFs included are for background purposes only:

- file "UCA-geodynamics-lesson05-stress.pdf": Lecture content (including discussion points) for U. Central Asia's geodynamics class; the "stress" lesson.
- file "MohrCircle details.pdf": Optional additional content for that lecture
- file "worksheet5.2 - Mohr circles intro.pdf": Worksheet for in-class (or homework) activity involving application of Mohr's circles.
- See also the supplamentary e-module for [chapters 4 & 5, "Stress"](https://folk.uib.no/nglhe/StructuralGeoBookEmodules2ndEd.html) in Haakon Fossen's textbook "Structural Geology".
- The second half of [Ch. 6 of Allmendinger (PDF)](http://www.geo.cornell.edu/geology/faculty/RWA/structure-lab-manual/chapter-6.pdf) is also helpful.
