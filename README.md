# Mohr's Circles

Experimental dashboard app for exploring geological stress and structures by manipulating Mohr's circles

Two versions (to become 1 version with 2 tabs): One with adjustable deviatoric and mean stress and a second with adjustable sigma1 and sigma3.

PDFs included with background are:

- file "UCA-geodynamics-lesson05-stress.pdf": Lecture content (including discussion points) for U. Central Asia's geodynamics class; the "stress" lesson.
- file "MohrCircle details.pdf": Optional additional content for that lecture
- file "worksheet5.2 - Mohr circles intro.pdf": Worksheet for in-class (or homework) activity involving application of Mohr's circles.
